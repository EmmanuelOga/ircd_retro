# IRCDRetro

This is a service for EmmanuelOga/ircd_slim IRC server. It runs a
brainstorming session which we tipically run with our team in our
Retrospective sesiions.

## How To

IRCDRetro has only been tested with ruby 1.9.2. Clone the repo, then
run:

bin/ircd_retro

Then all participants should be able to connect to the IRC server and
join the #retro room. Type .help for on screen instructions.

## TODO

You might need to checkout the rest of the gems from sources if I
haven't yet pushed them to rubygems:

* EmmanuelOga/ircd_slim
* EmmanuelOga/irc_parser
